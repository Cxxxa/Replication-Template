# Replication Template
 Template for a empirical research replication archive

## An example replication archive

This archive contains all necessary ingredients to run a Stata-based econometric analysis from start to finish. To begin, open the file "master\_dofile.do" contained in the "stata" folder.


## What is this?

The code is thoroughly commented inline, so read the code itself to see what it does.

To understand the philosophy of this replication archive, I recommend reading Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, "[Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner's Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf)"

## Future work

Corrections and suggestions are very welcome. Use this for whatever you like.

A future version of this will add Python and shell scripting to demonstrate how to make a more complicated project replicable. I also need to add some smaller Stata best-practices, like writing the final data set to a .dct plain-text format. When I will finish that, I do not know.
